# Water-Quality-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
Tools & Technologies
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Platform: Jupyter Notebook
•	Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Steps Taken
1.	Data Collection & Preprocessing 
o	Handle missing values through imputation techniques.
o	Normalize and standardize data where necessary.
o	Address class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
o	Visualize distributions of variables using histograms and boxplots.
o	Analyze correlations between features using heatmaps.
o	Identify outliers and address them accordingly.
3.	Model Development & Training 
o	Train various machine learning models.
o	Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
4.	Performance Evaluation 
o	Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
o	Assess feature importance to determine which variables most influence water potability.
